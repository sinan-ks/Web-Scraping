Instructions for Running the Script:

1) Install Required Packages:

   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
   - The script uses requests for making HTTP requests and jsonlines for handling JSON Lines format. If you haven't installed these packages, install them using pip:
          - pip install requests jsonlines

2) Run the Script:

    - Save the script provided by copying it into a .py file, such as Muhammed_Sinan_K_S_adidas.py.
    - Open a terminal or command prompt.
    - Navigate to the directory where Muhammed_Sinan_K_S_adidas.py is saved.
    - Run the script using Python :-
            - python Muhammed_Sinan_K_S_adidas.py

3) Script Execution:

    - The script will attempt to fetch data from the specified Adidas Thailand API endpoint (API_URL).
    - It will handle up to 3 retries (max_retries) if there are connection issues or errors.
    - Upon successful retrieval of store data, it will save the data into a file named Muhammed_Sinan_K_S_adidas_stores.jsonl in the same directory.
    - If no data is fetched or errors occur, appropriate messages will be printed to the console for debugging.

4) Verify Output:

    - After the script completes, check the generated Muhammed_Sinan_K_S_adidas_stores.jsonl file to ensure it contains the scraped store location data.
